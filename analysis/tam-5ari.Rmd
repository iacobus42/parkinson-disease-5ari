This file was compiled on `r lubridate::now()` by 
``r Sys.info()["effective_user"]`` on `r Sys.info()["nodename"]`. 

The script `analysis_functions.R` provides:

1. some functions for summarizing the cohort and building tables that are
   shared across scripts
2. code to load the entire collection out outcomes data (which it returns
   as `model_data` to the workspace)
3. sets `root_dir` according to the location where the script is being run to
   handle different syntax for referring to network drives in MacOS and CentOS

```{r}
source("~/projects/pd-preprint/analysis/analysis_functions.R")
```

## Data Load
### Unadjusted Data
The tibble `model_data` is loaded by `analysis_functions` from `r root_dir`.
`model_data` contains data on all users of the three drugs. We want to reduce
that here to just tamsulosin and 5ARI. 

```{r}
model_data <- model_data %>%
  filter(drug %in% c("5ari", "tamsulosin")) %>%
  mutate(treatment = drug == "tamsulosin")
```

### Matches
We also want to load our matching results:

```{r}
matches <- read_rds(glue::glue("{root_dir}/matches/tam_5ari.rds"))
```

And using the matches, build matched versions of the tamsulosin versus 5ARI
model data:

```{r}
matched_model_data <- model_data %>%
  select(-treatment) %>%
  inner_join(matches,
    by = "enrolid")
```

## Balance and Cohort Description
### Before Matching

```{r}
describe_cohort(model_data)
```

### After Matching

```{r}
describe_cohort(matched_model_data)
```

## Propensity Score Overlap
We can also visually inspect the estimated propensity scores for overlap:

```{r}
ps <- read_rds(glue::glue("{root_dir}/matching_candidates/tam_5ari.rds"))
bind_rows(
  model_data %>%
    inner_join(ps, by = "enrolid") %>%
    mutate(type = "Before Matching"),
  matched_model_data %>%
    inner_join(ps, by = "enrolid") %>%
    mutate(type = "After Matching")
  ) %>%
  mutate(type = forcats::fct_rev(type)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ptx, fill = drug, color = drug)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Probability of Treatment with Tamsulosin", 
       y = "Density",
       color = "Observed Treatment",
       fill = "Observed Treatment") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  facet_wrap(~ type, nrow = 2)
```

It is visually apparent that the two cohorts have a limited overlap before
matching, which is largely addressed with matching. 

## Survival Analysis
### Before Matching
Prior to matching, we observe a large survival difference with greater incidence
among men taking tamsulosin then 5ARI.

```{r}
survfit(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ treatment, 
        data = model_data) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(strata == "treatment=TRUE", 
    "Tamsulosin", "5ARI")) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = time / 365, 
      y = 100 * estimate,
      ymin = 100 * conf.low,
      ymax = 100 * conf.high
    )
  ) +
  geom_step(aes(color = treatment)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(fill = treatment), alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Years of Follow Up", y = "Percent Remaining PD Free",
       color = "", fill = "") + 
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.25))
```

A finding that is statistically significant using the log rank test:

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ treatment, 
         data = model_data)
```

The Cox regression pegs the protection at HR at 1.32 (1.22, 1.43).

```{r}
raw_cox <- coxph(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ as.numeric(treatment), 
                 data = model_data,
                 robust = TRUE)
tbl_regression(raw_cox, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

However, this estimate is not trustworthy as we know the groups could be 
better balanced.

### With Propensity Score Matching
Further adjustment yields similar results:

```{r}
survfit(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ drug, 
        data = matched_model_data) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(strata == "drug=tamsulosin", 
    "Tamsulosin", "5ARI")) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = time / 365, 
      y = 100 * estimate,
      ymin = 100 * conf.low,
      ymax = 100 * conf.high
    )
  ) +
  geom_step(aes(color = treatment)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(fill = treatment), alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Years of Follow Up", y = "Percent Remaining PD Free",
       color = "", fill = "") + 
  theme(legend.position = c(0.25, 0.25))
```

The population size at risk by year is given in the table below:

```{r}
survfit(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ drug, 
        data = matched_model_data) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  select(strata, time, n.risk) %>%
  complete(strata, time = 1:(10*365)) %>%
  fill(n.risk, .direction = "down") %>%
  mutate(drug = ifelse(strata == "drug=5ari", "5ARI", "Tamsulosin")) %>%
  select(time, drug, n.risk) %>%
  spread(drug, n.risk) %>%
  filter(time %in% c(0:10 * 365 + 1, 10 * 365)) %>%
  mutate(year = round(time / 365)) %>%
  select(year, Tamsulosin, `5ARI`) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

A log rank test confirms that the curves remain different but only with 
p = 0.05.

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ treatment, 
         data = matched_model_data)
```

We fit a Cox regression model to estimate the differences in hazard:

```{r}
full_cox <- coxph(Surv(survival_time, develops_pd) ~ as.numeric(treatment), 
                       data = matched_model_data,
                       robust = TRUE)
tbl_regression(full_cox, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

The Cox regression yields a HR of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.22; p = 0.0528). 

## Fit Summaries
```{r}
tbl_merge(
  tbls = list(
    tbl_regression(raw_cox, exponentiate = TRUE),
    tbl_regression(full_cox, exponentiate = TRUE)
  ),
  tab_spanner = c("Unadjusted", "Propensity Score Matched")
) %>% 
  as_flex_table()
```

## Diagnostics
```{r}
scf_residuals <- cox.zph(full_cox)
scf_residuals
with(scf_residuals, cor.test(x, y))
tibble(
  x = scf_residuals$time,
  y = scf_residuals$y
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x / 365, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  labs(x = "Follow Up Time in Years", y = "Schoenfeld Residual") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

There is a weak correlation that is not statistically significant when checking
the Schoenfeld residuals. It is unlikely to be a serious threat to our 
estimates.
