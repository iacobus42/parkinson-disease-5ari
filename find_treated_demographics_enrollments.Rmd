title: "Identify Enrollment Periods of Ever Users"
description: |
  The cohort identified in `find_treated.Rmd` is everyone who ever took one of
  the study drugs (TZ, DZ, AZ, tamsulosin, or a 5ARI). We want to impose three
  additional restrictions: male sex, age >= 40 at index date, and at least 
  one year of lookback to identify new users.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This file was compiled on `r lubridate::now()` by 
``r Sys.info()["effective_user"]`` on `r Sys.info()["nodename"]`. 

```{r pkg-load}
library(tidyverse)
```

We had previously computed the ever users in `find_rx_events.Rmd`. We use 
that pre-computed data to reduce the number of enrollments and demographic 
rows that we need to return. 

```{r data-load}
ever_users <- read_rds("/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/ever_users.rds")
```

## Pulling Demographics
Demographic data for Truven enrollees are stored in 
`/Shared/Statepi_Marketscan/databases/Truven/truven_demographics.db`. We
start by creating a connection to the database. 

```{r db-connect}
db_demo <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),
                          "/Shared/Statepi_Marketscan/databases/Truven/truven_demographics.db")
```

Then we pull back the rows matching one of our users. We are only interested 
in male users to reduce unobserved heterogenity and so we require `female == 0`
as well.

```{r demo-pull}
demographics <- tbl(db_demo, "demographics") %>%
  filter(female == 0) %>%
  filter(enrolid %in% local(ever_users$enrolid)) %>%
  select(enrolid, dobyr) %>%
  collect()
```

And close the connection.

```{r db-disconnect}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db_demo)
```

## Pulling Enrollments
Enrollment data is stored in 
`/Shared/Statepi_Marketscan/databases/Truven/truven_enrollments_corrected.db`.
Connect to that database:

```{r enrollment-db-connect}
db_enrollment <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),
                                "/Shared/Statepi_Marketscan/databases/Truven/truven_enrollments_corrected.db")
```

Since we are interested in medication exposures, we want to require the enrollee
to have prescription drug coverage to be included by requiring `rx == 1`. 
We are also only interested in collecting enrollments on the male ever users 
and so use `demographics$enrolid` as a filtering step. 

```{r pull-enrollments}
enrollments <- tbl(db_enrollment, "truven_enrollments") %>%
  filter(rx == 1) %>%
  filter(enrolid %in% local(demographics$enrolid)) %>%
  select(enrolid, start_date, end_date) %>%
  collect()
```

And closing the connection:

```{r enrollment-db-disconnect}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db_enrollment)
```

The resulting enrollments tibble has one row per enrollment period. New rows
are started when any of the other variables changed - e.g., MSA, state. We
are not interested in those variables and so we want to "merge" or "collapse"
these periods if contiguous. 

We do this by sorting the data by `enrolid` and then `start_date`. We compare
the current row to the prior row to see if either the `enrolid` value has 
changed or if the start of the current enrollment period is later than and 
non-contiguous with the end of the prior period. If either of these values is
true, we create a new period. 

```{r collapse-1}
collapsed_enrollments <- enrollments %>%
    arrange(enrolid, start_date) %>%
    mutate(
      break_enrolid = enrolid != lag(enrolid),
      break_time = start_date > lag(end_date + 1)
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      break_any = break_enrolid | break_time,
      break_any = replace_na(break_any, TRUE)
    )
```

We then calculate the cumulative sum of the `break_any` variable to make a 
period ID. We group by `enrolid` and `period`, which uniquely identify a 
collection of contiguous enrollment phases, and find the earliest and latest
date in that collection. 

```{r collapse-2}
collapsed_enrollments <- collapsed_enrollments %>%
    mutate(
      period = cumsum(break_any)
    ) %>%
    group_by(enrolid, period) %>%
    summarize(
      start_date = min(start_date),
      end_date = max(end_date),
      .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
    select(enrolid, start_date, end_date)
```

The resulting tibble has one row per contiguous enrollment period. If an 
enrollee has several non-contiguous enrollment periods, that enrollee will
have multiple rows.

## Write Data
Save the data we extracted for later use.

```{r data-write}
write_rds(demographics, "/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/treated_demographics.rds")
write_rds(collapsed_enrollments, "/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/treated_enrollments.rds")
```

## Session Info
```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
