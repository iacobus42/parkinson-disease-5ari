title: "Find Medication Start Date, Apply Exclusion Criteria"
description: |
  We want to find the medication start date and apply some basic exclusion
  rules (365 days of lookback, age over 40, male sex, PD free at medication 
  start) and restrict the enrollment period to the one where the medication 
  start was observed.

We need to find which users of the study drugs are exclusive users of only one
of the study drugs. Within the cohort of exclusive users, we need to use the 
data from `treated_demographics.rds` to remove anyone under age 40 and any 
females. We then impose the 1 year lookback and 1 day follow-up requirements 
using the enrollment identified in `treated_enrollments.rds`.

```{r data-load}
ever_users <- read_rds("/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/ever_users.rds")
demos <- read_rds("/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/treated_demographics.rds")
study_enrollments <- read_rds("/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/treated_enrollments.rds")
```

## Remove Anyone on More than One Study Drug
If there is more than 1 row for an `enrolid` in `ever_users`, they are a user
of more than 1 of the study medication groups (TZ/DZ/AZ, tamsulosin, 5ARI) and
we want to remove them. 

Before removing anyone, we have a total of `r NROW(unique(ever_users$enrolid))`
on at least one study medication at least once. We want to reduce that to the
number of unique users by removing people who use more than 1 study drug:

```{r remove-multi-users}
exclusive_users <- ever_users %>%
  group_by(enrolid) %>%
  filter(n() == 1)
```

We have a total of `r nrow(exclusive_users)` who are potentially newly started
on only one of the study drugs.

The breakdown by drug is:

```{r breakdown-exclusive-users}
exclusive_users %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Remove Any Female Users
Next, we want to remove any female users leaving only male users. 

```{r reduce-to-male-users}
male_users <- exclusive_users %>%
  inner_join(demos, by = "enrolid")
```

This leaves us with `r nrow(male_users)` participants with the breakdown:

```{r breakdown-male-users}
male_users %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Remove Anyone Under the Age of 40
In our next step, we want to apply the age 40+ requirement. BPH and PD are both
exceedingly uncommon under this age and inclusion of people under 40 who have
treatment for BPH or a diagnosis of PD are likely to be "weird" and not 
representative of the typical person at risk. 

```{r remove-young}
age_40_plus <- male_users %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter((lubridate::year(lubridate::as_date(first_rx_date)) - dobyr) >= 40)
```

This leaves us with `r nrow(age_40_plus)` participants:

```{r breakdown-40p-users}
age_40_plus %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Add Enrollment and Impose Lookback/Follow-Up Requirements
### Adding Enrollment
The enrollment tibble is one row per enrollment period. We want to join that 
to the index dates in `age_40_plus` and then narrow down to the rows where the
index date happens after the enrollment start date and before the enrollment
end date. 

```{r add-enrollment}
with_enrollments <- age_40_plus %>%
  mutate(enrolid = as.numeric(enrolid)) %>%
  inner_join(study_enrollments, by = "enrolid")
```

And then restricting to the correct enrollment:

```{r filter-to-enrollment}
with_enrollments <- with_enrollments %>%
  filter(first_rx_date >= start_date, first_rx_date <= end_date)
```

We want to restrict this one time further to be sure and eliminate any `enrolid`
with the index date following in more than 1 enrollment period. 

```{r remove-dups}
with_enrollments <- with_enrollments %>%
  group_by(enrolid) %>%
  filter(n() == 1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

We are left with `r nrow(with_enrollments)` users with an identifiable 
enrollment window. Some people start outside of this for weird, administrative
reasons (back dated coverage or what not) and we just want to avoid that. 

```{r breakdown-enrolled-users}
with_enrollments %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Lookback Requirement
We want at least 365 days of enrollment before the first start date. This is 
how we are defining new users. 

```{r impose-lookback}
with_lookback <- with_enrollments %>%
  filter(first_rx_date > (start_date + 365))
```

We have `r nrow(with_lookback)` users:

```{r breakdown-with-lookback-users}
with_lookback %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Follow-Up Requirement
People are no good to us if they leave the data on the date of medication 
start. We want to impose at least 1 day of follow-up. 

```{r impose-follow-up}
with_follow_up <- with_lookback %>%
  filter(end_date > first_rx_date)
```

We have `r nrow(with_follow_up)` users:

```{r breakdown-with-followup-users}
with_follow_up %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Remove Anyone with PD On or Before the Index Date
We want to remove anyone who has developed PD on or before the index date.
Obviously, survival time cannot be negative. 

Load the PD dates computed by `find_pd_dates.Rmd`

```{r load-pd-dates}
pd_dates <- read_rds("/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/first_pd_date.rds")
```

and combine with `left_join()` with the enrollments in `with_lookback`:

```{r add-pd}
with_follow_up <- with_follow_up %>%
  left_join(pd_dates %>%
              mutate(enrolid = as.numeric(enrolid)), 
            by = "enrolid")
```

With the following rates of PD during the lookback period.

```{r summary-pd-by-drug}
with_follow_up %>%
  mutate(
    pd_before_drug = ifelse(is.na(pd_date), FALSE, pd_date <= first_rx_date)
  ) %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(
    cases = sum(pd_before_drug),
    n = n(),
    py = sum(first_rx_date - start_date + 1) / 365
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    rate = cases / n * 100,
    incidence_10k = cases / py * 10000
  )
```

We remove the cases where PD occurred before the index date:

```{r}
without_pd <- with_follow_up %>%
  filter(is.na(pd_date) | pd_date > first_rx_date)
```

Leaving us with `r nrow(without_pd)` enrollees:

```{r breakdown-pd-free-users}
without_pd %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Remove Anyone With Fewer Than 2 RX Events in the First Year
An additional requirement is that the men have at least 2 dispensing claims for
the study drug within the first year of use. This is an attempt to narrow our
sample to a cohort of true users, as opposed to people who immediately d/c'ed
the drug. 

We load the entire set of rx events:

```{r load-rx-events}
rx_events <- read_rds("/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/treated_rx_events.rds")
```

We can quickly reduce this to only the RX events that occur in one of our 
candidate men:

```{r restrict-rx-to-cohort}
rx_events_in_first_year <- rx_events %>%
  mutate(enrolid = as.numeric(enrolid)) %>%
  inner_join(without_pd %>%
               select(enrolid, first_rx_date),
             by = "enrolid") %>%
  filter(svcdate <= (first_rx_date + 365))
```

And then get a count of RX events in the first year:

```{r count-rx}
rx_count <- rx_events_in_first_year %>%
  select(enrolid, svcdate) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(enrolid) %>%
  summarize(n_rx = n())
```

Then use this to filter `without_pd` to those with `n_rx >= 2`:

```{r filter-without-pd}
two_or_more <- without_pd %>%
  inner_join(rx_count, by = "enrolid") %>%
  filter(n_rx >= 2)
```

## Sample Size by Exclusion Step
```{r}
bind_rows(
  exclusive_users %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "Exclusive Users", row = 1),

    mutate(label = "Two or More RX Events in First Year", row = 8)
  ) %>%
  select(row, label, `tz/dz/az`, `tamsulosin`, `5ari`) %>%
  knitr::kable()

bind_rows(
  exclusive_users %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "Exclusive Users", row = 1),

    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "Aged 40 or Older", row = 3),
  with_enrollments %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "With Identified Enrollment", row = 4),
  with_lookback %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "With >365 Days of Lookback", row = 5),
  with_follow_up %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "With >= 1 Days of Follow-Up", row = 6),
  without_pd %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "Without PD at Index date", row = 7),
  two_or_more %>%
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    spread(drug, n) %>%
    mutate(label = "Two or More RX Events in First Year", row = 8)
  ) %>%
  gather(drug, n, -label, -row) %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(n / max(n) * 100, 2)
  ) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  spread(drug, pct) %>%
  select(row, label, `tz/dz/az`, `tamsulosin`, `5ari`) %>%
  arrange(row) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Write Out

We now have the required data for the candidate men treated with the study 
drugs. We have the following tibble that describes their assignment, index
date, enrollment start, enrollment end dates, and their date of birth. 

```{r tibble-preview}
two_or_more <- two_or_more %>%
  select(enrolid, drug, index_date = first_rx_date, start_date, end_date)
two_or_more
```

Broken down over the following treatment assignments:

```{r tibble-summary}
two_or_more %>%
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    person_years = sum(end_date - start_date + 1) / 365
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

We then write this out for use in building the model data sets and the 
propensity score matching.

```{r save}
write_rds(two_or_more,
          "/Shared/lss_jsimmeri_backup/data/tz-5ari-final/candidate_treated.rds")
```
